            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p>
            Surabaya, the capital of East Java, boasts a rich historical narrative that traces back to its significance as a bustling trade port. Historically known as "The City of Heroes," Surabaya played a crucial role during Indonesia's fight for independence, particularly in the battle against colonial forces. As students from the Software Engineering program (RPL), we recognize the importance of sharing this vibrant history. Our goal is to highlight Surabaya's pivotal role in shaping the nation's identity and instill a sense of pride in its residents and visitors alike.
